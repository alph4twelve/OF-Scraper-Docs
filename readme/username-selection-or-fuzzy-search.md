ofscraper uses fuzzy search to make managing which models are selected easier

This is an approximation search that attempts to find good matches for the string you enter

The confusing part of this process is which models are selected.

## Selecting a model

For all models

```
ctrl- R
```

For a single model you can hit

```
home+right
```

```
pageDown+right
```

```
 shift+Right
```

## Sorting/Filtering List

This will allow you to change the filters that control which models appear on the list

and the order they are sorted in

```
ctrl-z 
```

## Searching the list

This is as easy as typing for example

The result will be based on your account, and the filters that you have applied

Typing 1 here filters out all other non-matching options

The result is only 1 appears here

### How does searching effect my currectly select models?

It doesn't it only effects which models appear in the list for example

Even though in the second image my previously selected options no longer appear, they are still selected. This can be seen by the (3) in parenthesis

The parenthesis indicates the number of selected options

### Unselecting

You need to change the filter to an empty string, or provide one that shows the model you want to remove

Again you can use the previously mention keys to toggle between selected and unselected

For all models

```
ctrl- R
```

For a single model you can hit

```
home+right
```

```
pageDown+right
```

```
 shift+Right
```
