The easiest way is to run this command

```
ofscraper
```

Technically any command without a scraping option will trigger the menu to show

## Edit Profile

Use this option to

* add profiles
* change the default profile
* rename a profile
* delete profile

Each profile is tied to a single account, so if you want to have more then one account. You will need multiple profiles

## Edit config.json

If you want to avoid digging for where the config file is located, used this to change settings from within the script

Your previous selections will be provided, and you will have an opportunity to edit them

## Edit auth.json

Typically this is not a setting that needs to be access manually

However you can use this to change auth settings for the current profile

Note that if auth fails the auth menu options will be picked automatically
