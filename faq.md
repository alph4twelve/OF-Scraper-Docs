## Scrape entire paid page or --scape-paid should I do it

It really depends on how much content you've purchased.

#### Does the regular scraper get purchased content?

Yes if you selected "purchased" then all purchased content for selected models will be scraped. This is done by using the models username as an input on the purchase page

#### Then why the prompt

Some models have deleted accounts, and getting there purchases requires scanning the entire purchase page. They have no name to use as an input

#### When would you use to use it&#x20;

I would use it once on the first run just to get what is in your library Then I would use it if you haven't scan in a while

#### When would you not use it

&#x20;I do at least one scan a day So I would turn it off for most scans, after the initial scan
