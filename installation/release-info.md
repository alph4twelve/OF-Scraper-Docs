## Release types

## Files

### .zip

You can unzip these and the resulting folder can be use to run the script by using the ofscraper file in the directory.&#x20;

The only difference between this and other release is that startup can be slightly faster with a zip, and directory because a temp folder doesn't need to be made every time you start the script

You will want to run the file that starts with ofscraper\_ in your terminal program
