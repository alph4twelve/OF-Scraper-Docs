# Release Info

## Release types

### package\_

These are releases from commits. Basically they are version that come in between the different numbered releases. They can be more up to date, but also can have issues that haven't been resolved yet



### numbered i.e X.X.X

These are meant to be stable releases



## Files

### .zip

You can unzip these and the resulting folder can be use to run the script by using the ofscraper file in the directory.&#x20;

The only difference between this and other release is that startup can be slightly faster with a zip, and directory because a temp folder doesn't need to be made every time you start the script

You will want to run the file that starts with ofscraper\_ in your terminal program
